## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.


### Index.html

*lines 16 to 25*

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 

<select name="days-of-week" id="days">
            <option value="monday">Monday</option>
            <option value="tuesday">Tuesday</option>
            <option value="wednesday">Wednesday</option>
            <option value="thursday">Thursday</option>
            <option value="friday">Friday</option>
            <option value="saturday">Saturday</option>
            <option value="sunday">Sunday</option>

        </select>

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp) as shown below: 

```
<label for="cars">Choose a car:</label>

<select name="cars" id="cars">
  <option value="volvo">Volvo</option>
  <option value="saab">Saab</option>
  <option value="mercedes">Mercedes</option>
  <option value="audi">Audi</option>
</select>

```

- <!---How---> The code in [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp) was implemented by knowing the syntax for select
- <!---Why---> [W3 schoolsW3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)'s Code was used because it showed how to use the select 
- <!---How---> [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp)'s Code was modified by Tyler Wansbrough

*Repeat as needed*


### script.js

*Lines 54-58*

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 
//check even or odd
    if (number%2 === 0) {
        result1 = "The number entered is an even ";
    }
    else {
        result1 = "The number entered is an odd ";
    }

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5016313/how-to-determine-if-a-number-is-odd-in-javascript) as shown below: 

```
Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing

function isEven(value){
    if (value%2 == 0)
        return true;
    else
        return false;
}

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5016313/how-to-determine-if-a-number-is-odd-in-javascript) was implemented by changing the results of the if and else statement
- <!---Why---> [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5016313/how-to-determine-if-a-number-is-odd-in-javascript) Code was used because i forgot how to check even or odd
- <!---How---> [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5016313/how-to-determine-if-a-number-is-odd-in-javascript)'s Code was modified by Tyler Wansbrough
