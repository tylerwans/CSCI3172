## Built With

<!--- Provide a list of the frameworks used to build this application, your list should include the name of the framework used, the url where the framework is available for download and what the framework was used for, see the example below --->

* [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds



## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.





### script.js

*Lines 11-16 *

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 
function checkPrime(num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false; 
        for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i === 0) return false; 
        }
        return true;
    }


```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40200089/check-number-prime-in-javascript) as shown below: 

```
Copy and paste the snippet of code you are referencing
const isPrime = num => {
    for(let i = 2, s = Math.sqrt(num); i <= s; i++) {
        if(num % i === 0) return false;
    }
    return num > 1;
}

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40200089/check-number-prime-in-javascript) was implemented by changing the results of for loop
- <!---Why---> [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40200089/check-number-prime-in-javascript) Code was used because i forgot how to check prime
- <!---How---> [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40200089/check-number-prime-in-javascript)'s Code was modified by Tyler Wansbrough

*Repeat as needed*



## Artificial Intelligence Tools Used
