## Sources Used

If in completing your lab / assignment / project you used any interpretation of someone else's code, then provide a list of where the code was implemented, how it was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it was modified. See the sections below for more details.


### Script.js

*lines 6*

```
Copy and paste your code on lines mentioned 

const random = Math.round(Math.random() * (max - min) + min);

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) as shown below: 

```
function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {
  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) was implemented by using the math.random function
- <!---Why---> [Mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)'s Code was used because it showed how to get a random value within 2 numbers
- <!---How---> [Mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random)'s Code was modified by Tyler Wansbrough

*Repeat as needed*
